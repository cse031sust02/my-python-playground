# Python’s approach to interface design is somewhat different when
# compared to languages like Java, Go, and C++. These languages all
# have an interface keyword, while Python does not. Python further
# deviates from other languages in one other aspect. It doesn’t
# require the class that’s implementing the interface to define all
# of the interface’s abstract methods.
