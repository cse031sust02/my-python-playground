# Python’s approach to interface design is somewhat different when compared
# to languages like Java, Go, and C++. There’s no interface keyword in Python.
# Actaully interfaces are not necessary in Python because Python has proper
# multiple inheritance, and also ducktyping. If we still need to use interfaces
# in python, We can create informal or formal interfaces using Abstract Base
# Classes and other techniques.
