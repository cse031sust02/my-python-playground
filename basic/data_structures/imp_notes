- List, Dictionary and Set are mutable

- Tuple is immutable

- Sets can't contain mutable items

- In Dictionary, keys should be immutubale data structures (tuple, string, int etc)

copy :
--------
Assignment statements in Python do not create copies of objects, they only bind names to an object.
For collections that are mutable or contain mutable items, If we change one copy, the other copy will be changed.

For example, while creating new list/dictionary/tuple from another list/dictionary/tuple using assignment statements 
(i.e., new_list = old_list), any modifications to new list/dictionary/tuple will changes new list/dictionary/tuple 
(and vice versa) everytime. Because they are references to the same underlying object (just different names for the
same thing).

To create a copy, we can use the builtin copy method or other options.
