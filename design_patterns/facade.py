"""Facade Pattern

What is Facade Pattern?
---------------------------
Facade Pattern wraps a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface.
We can use Facade Pattern when we want to hide a complex subsystem from
our calling class. This pattern is also useful when we have legacy code to work
with. We can create a facade (wrapper) around the original classes to simplify
their usage.

Real world example
---------------------
We can turn on a computer by just pressing a button, but internally there are lot
of stuff to going on. The on/off buttons serve as simple interfaces to all the
underlying procedures.
